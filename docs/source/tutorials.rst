ResNet-50
---------

.. todo::

   Structure:

   1. Intro
   2. Step-by-step installation of "model" (clone, setup, ...)
   3. Code snippet(s)/overview (explain what happens in the application: what does ResNet/ImageNet do?)
   4. How to run (``tarantella``)
   5. Advanced topics/points, including...

   ...points to touch:

   * scaling batch size with number of ranks
   * introduce learning rate warm up
   * introduce learning rate scaling (with #ranks)


Transformers
------------

.. todo::

   * same (similar) structure as above
   * mixing Keras and Tarantella Models in the same application
