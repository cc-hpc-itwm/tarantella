========================

`Tarantella <https://github.com/cc-hpc-itwm/tarantella>`_
is an open-source, distributed Deep Learning framework built on top of TensorFlow 2,
providing scalable Deep Neural Network training on CPU and GPU compute clusters.

Tarantella is easy-to-use, allows to re-use existing TensorFlow/Keras models,
and does not require any knowledge of parallel computing.
