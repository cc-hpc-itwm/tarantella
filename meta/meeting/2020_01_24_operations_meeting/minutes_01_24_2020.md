HP-DLF Meeting 2020 --- Meeting Minutes
======

## date: 01/24/2020
## time: 10.00 -- 14.00
## attendees:
  * Alexandra Carpen-Amarie [ACA]
  * Martin Kuehn [MK]
  * Peter Labus [PL]

## Goal: Define work plan for February

## Tasks for Feb
* **Highest priority:** benchmarks for the report [@MK, @ACA]
  - cf. below
* Profiling [@MK]
  - where are the performance bottlenecks?
  - where is potential for performance improvement
* Optimizations [@MK]
  - Switch from waiting for all the reduce operations to overlapping wait with update ops
  - Implement multiple types of reduce operations in the Allreduce collective (sum and average)
* Refactoring & beyond [@ACA]
  - Wrap Keras model instead of Optimizer in TF
  - Refactoring
  - Pipelining

**TODO:** Organize meeting for refactoring with Bernd & Mirko [@PL]

### HPDLF Project Report (due Feb 10)
- 1 week
- benchmarks - ResNet CIFAR10
  - scaling (up to 64, 128 nodes)
  - compare to horovod (with MPI)
  - experiments with CPUs only
- fix data loader/hyperparameters
- Taurus (or seislab if we cannot get nodes on Taurus)

**TODO:** check whether we have access to the Haswell nodes on Taurus [@MK]

### Benchmarks (1 week)
* Requirements:
  - GPUs
  - time per epoch
  - final accuracy (after a fixed number of epochs)
  - scaling 
* Could be useful to have
  - comparison to Horovod
* ResNet-100 with ImageNet
* For now do *not* benchmark:
  - Unet3D
  - Transformers
